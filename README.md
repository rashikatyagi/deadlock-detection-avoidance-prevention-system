# Deadlock Detection, Avoidance and Prevention System

This Java-based project simulates deadlock handling in operating systems. It supports **deadlock detection**, **avoidance** (Banker's Algorithm), and **prevention** techniques. The system allows dynamic resource allocation and visual representation of processes, making it ideal for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- ✅ Deadlock Detection
- 🧠 Deadlock Avoidance (Banker's Algorithm)
- 🔒 Deadlock Prevention Techniques
- 🎛️ Interactive GUI for input and visualization
- 🧩 Dynamic process and resource management

## Technologies Used

- Java (JavaFX for GUI)
- OOP and Simulation-based logic
- Data structures for process and resource modeling

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher

### Steps to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deadlock-system.git
   cd deadlock-system
2. Compile the java file :
   ```bash
   javac DeadlockGUI.java
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java DeadlockGUI
